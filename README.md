# note TAKING APPLICATION

## Description 
Notetaking is a nessessity in life, whether you want to be more detail oriented, wanted new and exciting views on something, if you can take notes on it, it will describe your specific thoughts on something. You can look and reflect on this as much as you want with this new note taking application. This application saves notes and creates new ones using a green aesthetically pleasing design packet to do so. By using this application, a person can and will take notes. I specifically built this application to take notes for the subjects that I specifically am studying up on. The biggest problem I had with this was the folder structure and the application as I had to import different code from a mini project to make this specific project work. But other than that, please take notes and reflect!
